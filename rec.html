                <li>Salt, to taste</li>

<div class="ins">
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the eggs: in a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
            <li> Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is metted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
            <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        </ol>
